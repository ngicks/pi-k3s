# pi-k3s Development Guidelines

Auto-generated from all feature plans. Last updated: 2025-10-29

## Using Serena MCP Tool

This project has been onboarded with the Serena MCP tool. Use `mcp__serena__` commands to access and store project information. The serena memories complement the documentation in the `./doc` directory.

- You must use serena tools where possible.
- You'll have to read/update serena memory.
- You must not use built-in read / write tool
- You must not use bash to search lines, symbols. Just update serena memory and use serena tools.
