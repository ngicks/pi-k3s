# Suggested Commands

- `git status` â€“ check working tree state.
- No project-specific build, test, or lint commands are defined yet.
- `.specify/scripts/bash/` contains helper scripts for future workflow automation (e.g., `create-new-feature.sh`, `setup-plan.sh`), but they are not documented or referenced in README.
