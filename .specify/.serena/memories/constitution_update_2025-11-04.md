## Constitution Update 2025-11-04
- Raised constitution to v1.0.1 with clarified requirement that GitOps evidence (ansible/k8s/helm diffs) must be archived in timestamped folders under `docs/governance/reviews/<date>-<change>/`.
- Aligned plan, spec, and tasks templates to reference the same evidence archive location so Constitution Checks point to consistent governance storage.
- Governance section now points to `docs/governance/reviews/constitution-log.md` for amendment records.
- No other principles or operational constraints changed; update classified as a PATCH release.
