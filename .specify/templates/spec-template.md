# Feature Specification: [FEATURE NAME]

**Feature Branch**: `[###-feature-name]`  
**Created**: [DATE]  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "$ARGUMENTS"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

<!--
  IMPORTANT: User stories should be PRIORITIZED as user journeys ordered by importance.
  Each user story/journey must be INDEPENDENTLY TESTABLE - meaning if you implement just ONE of them,
  you should still have a viable MVP (Minimum Viable Product) that delivers value.
  
  Assign priorities (P1, P2, P3, etc.) to each story, where P1 is the most critical.
  Think of each story as a standalone slice of functionality that can be:
  - Developed independently
  - Tested independently
  - Deployed independently
  - Demonstrated to users independently
-->

### User Story 1 - [Brief Title] (Priority: P1)

[Describe this user journey in plain language]

**Why this priority**: [Explain the value and why it has this priority level]

**Independent Test**: [Describe how this can be tested independently - e.g., "Can be fully tested by [specific action] and delivers [specific value]"]

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]
2. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]

---

### User Story 2 - [Brief Title] (Priority: P2)

[Describe this user journey in plain language]

**Why this priority**: [Explain the value and why it has this priority level]

**Independent Test**: [Describe how this can be tested independently]

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]

---

### User Story 3 - [Brief Title] (Priority: P3)

[Describe this user journey in plain language]

**Why this priority**: [Explain the value and why it has this priority level]

**Independent Test**: [Describe how this can be tested independently]

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]

---

[Add more user stories as needed, each with an assigned priority]

### Edge Cases

- Node bootstrap fails mid-run (power loss, flaky storage) — automation MUST resume cleanly.
- GitOps controller is offline — define how deployments are blocked and recovered.
- Secrets rotation occurs during deployment — document blast radius and recovery.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: Automation MUST submit all cluster changes through GitOps with diff evidence attached.
- **FR-002**: Provisioning workflows MUST rebuild a node from blank media within 60 minutes.
- **FR-003**: Workloads MUST ship arm64 images or a documented build pipeline.
- **FR-004**: Monitoring MUST emit alerts for workload and node health aligned with observability principle.
- **FR-005**: Runbooks MUST be updated alongside the feature and linked in this spec.
- **FR-006**: Secrets MUST remain encrypted-at-rest in source control. TODO(SECRET_TOOL): Confirm mechanism.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **[Entity 1]**: [What it represents, key attributes without implementation]
- **[Entity 2]**: [What it represents, relationships to other entities]

## Operational Readiness *(mandatory)*

- **GitOps Evidence**: Attach expected `kubectl diff`/`helm template` output or CI job references.
- **Idempotence Proof**: Describe how provisioning or scripts demonstrate repeatable convergence.
- **Access & Secrets**: Detail RBAC changes and how secrets stay encrypted (reference TODOs if unresolved).
- **Observability Hooks**: Enumerate metrics/logs/alerts added or updated for this feature.
- **Runbook Updates**: Identify `docs/runbooks/` entries touched and validation steps executed post-change.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Define measurable success criteria.
  These must be technology-agnostic and measurable.
-->

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: [Measurable metric, e.g., "Users can complete account creation in under 2 minutes"]
- **SC-002**: [Measurable metric, e.g., "System handles 1000 concurrent users without degradation"]
- **SC-003**: [User satisfaction metric, e.g., "90% of users successfully complete primary task on first attempt"]
- **SC-004**: [Business metric, e.g., "Reduce support tickets related to [X] by 50%"]
