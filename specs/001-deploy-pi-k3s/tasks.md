# Tasks: Set Up Pi k3s Cluster

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-deploy-pi-k3s/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: Use CI dry-runs (`kubectl diff`, `ansible-playbook --check`) and lightweight shell tests. Include them only if explicitly requested in the feature specification.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- `automation/ansible/`: Provisioning and configuration playbooks.
- `automation/scripts/`: Shell helpers invoked manually or via CI.
- `cluster/base/`: Shared manifests (namespaces, ingress, monitoring).
- `cluster/apps/<service>/`: Workload-specific overlays.
- `docs/runbooks/`: Operational documentation to update with every change.
- `docs/governance/`: Compliance evidence and review logs.
- `tests/automation/` & `tests/k8s-diff/`: Idempotence checks and manifest diff assertions.

<!-- 
  ============================================================================
  IMPORTANT: The tasks below are SAMPLE TASKS for illustration purposes only.
  
  The /speckit.tasks command MUST replace these with actual tasks based on:
  - User stories from spec.md (with their priorities P1, P2, P3...)
  - Feature requirements from plan.md
  - Entities from data-model.md
  - Endpoints from contracts/
  
  Tasks MUST be organized by user story so each story can be:
  - Implemented independently
  - Tested independently
  - Delivered as an MVP increment
  
  DO NOT keep these sample tasks in the generated tasks.md file.
  ============================================================================

## Phase 1: GitOps & Documentation Foundations

**Purpose**: Prepare repository artifacts, inventory, and configuration required before automation work begins.

- [X] T001 Create Ansible inventory with control-plane/workers groups in `automation/ansible/inventory/hosts.yml`.
- [X] T002 Add Ansible configuration defaults (pipelining, callbacks) in `automation/ansible/ansible.cfg`.
- [X] T003 [P] Initialize `uv` project configuration in `pyproject.toml` declaring Ansible tooling dependencies (`ansible`, `ansible-lint`, `kubernetes`).
- [X] T004 [P] Document `uv` environment setup and usage steps in `README.md`, including commands to create/activate the virtual environment.

## Phase 2: Provisioning & Node Health Prerequisites

**Purpose**: Ensure automation scaffolding, secrets handling, and manual diff capture exist before story work.

- [ ] T005 Create role scaffolding (`tasks/`, `handlers/`, `templates/`) for `base_os`, `k3s_server`, `k3s_agent`, and `post_bootstrap` under `automation/ansible/roles/`.
- [ ] T006 [P] Stub playbook entry points in `automation/ansible/site.yml` with plays targeting control-plane and worker groups.
- [ ] T007 [P] Configure repository-wide SOPS policy in `.sops.yaml` covering `cluster/` and `docs/governance/`.

- [ ] T009 [P] Capture secrets rotation checklist skeleton in `docs/runbooks/secrets-rotation.md`.
- [ ] T010 Record hardware/environment prerequisites in `docs/runbooks/hardware.md`.

**Checkpoint**: Provisioning scaffolding ready; story-specific automation can proceed.

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **GitOps & Documentation (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - establish repo scaffolding first.
- **Provisioning & Node Health (Phase 2)**: Depends on Phase 1 completion - BLOCKS all user stories.
- **User Stories (Phase 3+)**: Depend on Phase 2 completion; execute in priority order (US1 ‚Üí US2 ‚Üí US3).
- **Polish (Final Phase)**: Depends on all user stories being complete and validated.

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Starts after Phase 2; no dependency on other stories.
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Requires US1 automation baseline to exist but remains independently testable via rebuild drills.
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Depends on US1 infrastructure for metrics endpoints; rebuild workflows (US2) not strictly required but enhance alert testing.

### Within Each User Story

- Diff/dry-run evidence MUST exist before applying manifests.
- Secrets and RBAC updates MUST be merged only after reviewers confirm scope.
- Runbook documentation MUST be drafted alongside manifest changes.
- Monitoring/alert updates MUST be validated before declaring the story complete.

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Phase 1 tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (inventory config, requirements file).
- Phase 2 tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (SOPS setup, diff helper, documentation scaffolds).
- Within US1, parallelize role implementations (`base_os`, `k3s_server`, `k3s_agent`).
- Within US2, rebuild automation and documentation can progress concurrently once tags exist.
- Within US3, Helm values, Loki manifests, and alert routes can be authored simultaneously after secrets workflow is finalized.

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch dry-run checks for User Story 1 together (if requested):
Task: "Run kubectl diff for cluster/base/system/"
Task: "Run ansible-playbook --check automation/ansible/site.yml"

# Launch all observability updates for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Validate manifest diff via tests/k8s-diff/test_baseline.sh"
Task: "Update governance evidence template in docs/governance/reviews/bootstrap-template.md"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: GitOps & Documentation Foundations
2. Complete Phase 2: Provisioning & Node Health (blocks workload phases)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Run bootstrap smoke tests, collect diff evidence, and confirm runbooks
5. Deploy/demo if ready

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Phases 1 + 2 ‚Üí Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (MVP)
3. Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
4. Add User Story 3 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
5. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Phases 1 + 2 together
2. Once Phase 2 is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (Ansible roles + baseline manifests)
   - Developer B: User Story 2 (rebuild automation + drills)
   - Developer C: User Story 3 (observability + alerting)
3. Stories complete and integrate independently

---

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Verify tests fail before implementing
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence
